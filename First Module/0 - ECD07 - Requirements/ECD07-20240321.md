## Motivation

From the perspective of software engineering

Software is a product, and it's development needs engineering (and maintenance)

Engineering = Usage of scientific knowledge to build a product

There are complaints commonly made like:

- amateurism
- tinkering
- unreliability
- messiness
- opaque
- too late vs prediction
- too costly vs prediction

Lately it's even more challenging because:

- users demand quality
- users demand complex features
- software is still knowledge driven
- too many and too diverse platforms, tools, architectures...

The main constraints to be respected are

- user requirements
- budget
- deadlines

In actuality these are commonly violated, and software engineers have high levels of stress

Thus it is proper to have methodologies to engineer software, as opposed to using ad-hoc approaches

Main motivation for Software Engineering is:

- Attend clients necessities/requirements
- Reduce failures and errors (not up to specification)
- Enhance the software quality
- Reduce difficulty of maintenance
- Manage development cycle including budget and time
