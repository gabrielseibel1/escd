## Requirements

requirements = necessary conditions to achieve an objective

### Classification 1

can be either:

- what a product must do
- constraint with how the product should do something

### Classification 2

can be EITHER OR BOTH:

- functional: what the product does, when it does that, what it provides
- non-functional: how the product does things

This division should be useful only for organization sake, but it can be phrased in a mixed fashion.

e.g.

Functional

> [FR001] Manager should be able to query xyz  
> [FR002] Client may check availability of abc  

Non-functional

> [NR001] Product should return responses in under 0.1us  
> [NR002] Product should return responses that are correct at least 90% of the time  
> [NR003] Product should be portable to platforms xyz  
> [NR004] Responses should follow RST standard  

### Classification 3

can be an inverse requirement

> [IR001] Product doesn't need to do X
> [IR002] Product shouldn't do Y

## Usefulness

Requirements can be useful for

- defining criteria for acceptance and validation (with stakeholders)
- defining what the system should do (spec for dev team)
- testing and verifying of the system under development
- managing and tracking for changes
- allocating tasks for the team
- estimating costs/efforts/schedule
- tracking and controlling the development project
